Editing Velocity and Freemarker files in Layout Templates and Themes
====================================================================

Velocity and Freemarker files are being used at different places.

## Description

**Liferay Layout template** are using ``.tpl`` files. This plugin defines that those files should be handled as Velocity files, so
all Velocity features like highlighting, syntax checking and code completions are available.

**Liferay Themes** can be created with Freemarker or Velocity. This plugin defines implicit variables which are usable in those files.
Code Completion works.

Additionally basic Velocity and Freemarker macros are available. For Freemarker, known Liferay Taglibs are available as additional namespaces (Liferay 7 / DXP only).

If you are using ```<@aui:script>``` tags etc. the content is detected as Javascript, too.

If you have defined custom theme settings in your ```liferay-look-and-feel.xml``` those are are provided for code completion, too. You can jump
to the declaration in the ```liferay-look-and-feel.xml```.

Known path variables like ```${images_folder}``` are resolved, so code completion e.g. for images in your theme works.

Specific variables like ```serviceLocator``` are detected, so that code completion for the classnames work and the assigned
variable is treated as an object of the given classname.

For Liferay 7.x this plugin provides JSON schemas for journal structure files.
